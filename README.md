# CDWAgent

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes a de-identified **Epic Caboodle Clinical Data Warehouse** (SQL Server) to [**BioRouter**](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/BioRouter).

Built for clinical researchers who need natural-language access to EHR data without writing SQL. Designed as a sibling of [UCSFOMOPAgent](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/UCSFOMOPAgent): CDWAgent targets the UF Epic Caboodle schema while OMOPAgent targets the OHDSI/OMOP common data model. Both can be enabled in the same BioRouter session — tool names are namespace-prefixed to prevent collision, and CDWAgent includes a `crossmap_patient` tool that resolves OMOP `person_id` values to CDW `PatientDurableKey`.

Architecture is based on the [MedCP](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/MedCP) template by the UCSF Baranzini Lab, with a modular tool registry, expanded clinical tools, and no knowledge graph dependency.

## Tools

All tool names are namespace-prefixed with `CDW-` at runtime so they coexist with sibling agents (e.g., `UCSFOMOPAgent`) inside a single BioRouter session. The descriptions below are the canonical entry points each tool exposes; for the per-tool flow diagrams see [`docs/agent-flows/02-tool-flows/`](docs/agent-flows/02-tool-flows/).

### Schema Discovery (3)

These tools read from the bundled `schema_reference.json` and require no database connection — they work offline for exploratory research.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_database_overview` | List every CDW table with one-line description, patient/encounter linkage flags, and column counts. The agent uses this as its first move when a research question lacks an obvious target table. |
| `describe_table` | Return the column list for a named table — names, data types, descriptions, and foreign-key relationships. Used to construct schema-aware SQL after a candidate table has been identified. |
| `search_schema` | Keyword search across table and column names plus their descriptions. Useful when the user describes a clinical concept (e.g. "lab results") rather than a table name. |

### Clinical Queries (7)

These tools execute SELECT-only SQL against the de-identified Epic Caboodle warehouse. Every executed statement is validated by `ClinicalQueryValidator` (read-only enforcement, no semicolon chaining, blocked write verbs) and appended to the SQL audit log at `$TMPDIR/cdwagent_sql.log`.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `query` | Execute a read-only SQL `SELECT` query (or `WITH ... SELECT`) and return the rows as CSV. The validator blocks every write verb. The cohort subquery pattern (`WHERE PatientDurableKey IN (...)`) is the recommended composition primitive for cross-fact queries. |
| `get_patient_demographics` | Return the most recent demographic record for a `PatientDurableKey` from `PatientDim` (filtered by `IsCurrent = 1`). Sex, birth date, race, ethnicity, language, status. |
| `get_encounters` | Encounter history from `EncounterFact` for one patient, ordered by `DateKey` descending. Includes department specialty, encounter type, and visit type. |
| `get_medications` | Medication orders from `MedicationOrderFact` for one patient, with `OrderedDateKey`/`StartDateKey`/`EndDateKey` so the agent can reconstruct treatment duration. |
| `get_diagnoses` | Diagnosis history from `DiagnosisEventFact` for one patient, ordered by `StartDateKey`. Joined to `DiagnosisDim` for human-readable names and to `DiagnosisTerminologyDim` for the originating code system. |
| `get_labs` | Lab results from `LabComponentResultFact` for one patient. Returns the `Value` string field rather than `NumericValue` (de-identified and unreliable for analysis). |
| `crossmap_patient` | Resolve an OMOP `person_id` to a CDW `PatientDurableKey` via `OMOP_DEID.dbo.person.person_source_value = CDW_NEW.deid_uf.PatientDim.PatientEpicId` with `IsCurrent = 1`. Returns demographics plus a `birth_date_match` boolean for sanity-checking the join. The bridge tool when a study starts on the OMOP side and needs CDW depth. |

### Clinical Notes (4)

A two-tier retrieval surface: an NLP concept layer (cTAKES) for fast semantic search, and a verbatim layer for chart review or exact-phrase matching. The cTAKES layer is the preferred entry point for clinical concepts; verbatim retrieval is reserved for cases where the NLP layer would not normalise the phrase (specific provider names, exact dose phrasing, idiosyncratic wording).

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_note_concepts` | Search the NLP-extracted concept layer (`note_concepts`, populated by cTAKES) by canonical text or UMLS CUI, optionally restricted to a cohort of one or more `PatientDurableKey` values. Defaults exclude negated mentions and family-history mentions; historical mentions are kept (commonly relevant for retrospective research). Population-mode (no cohort) applies an early-termination optimisation and emits a `[NOTICE: ...]` banner that the agent must surface to the user. |
| `search_note_sdoh` | Search Social Determinants of Health concepts (`note_concepts_sdoh`, populated by the cTAKES SDOH module) — housing instability, food insecurity, employment, transportation barriers, substance use, social isolation, financial strain. Use for equity and vulnerability research where structured fields rarely capture the signal. Same population-mode notice convention as `search_note_concepts`. |
| `search_notes` | Verbatim text retrieval over `note_text` and `note_metadata`, scoped to a cohort of one or more `PatientDurableKey` values. Supports an optional keyword filter; without a keyword the call performs a chronological chart review. SQL Server `IN`-clause cap of 2000 patients. |
| `get_note` | Retrieve the full text of one clinical note by its `deid_note_key`, typically discovered via `search_note_concepts` or `search_notes`. |

### Concept Search (4)

These tools resolve human-language concept names or terminology codes into the surrogate keys used by fact tables. The agent uses them as the first step in any cohort-building workflow: it finds the relevant `*Key` values and then composes a `... IN (...)` filter on the corresponding fact table.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_diagnoses_by_code` | Resolve ICD/SNOMED codes or diagnosis names against `DiagnosisTerminologyDim` joined to `DiagnosisDim`. Returns `DiagnosisKey` values for use in `DiagnosisEventFact.DiagnosisKey IN (...)`. |
| `search_medications_by_code` | Resolve NDC/RxNorm codes, brand names, or generic names against `MedicationCodeDim`. Returns `MedicationKey` values for use in `MedicationOrderFact.MedicationKey IN (...)`. |
| `search_labs_by_code` | Resolve LOINC codes or lab component names (e.g. "hemoglobin a1c", "creatinine") against `LabComponentDim`. Returns `LabComponentKey` values for use in `LabComponentResultFact.LabComponentKey IN (...)`. Note the LOINC column is `LoincCode`, not `Loinc`. |
| `search_procedures_by_code` | Resolve CPT/HCPCS codes or procedure names against `ProcedureTerminologyDim`. Returns `ProcedureTerminologyKey` values for use in `ProcedureEventFact.ProcedureTerminologyKey IN (...)`. |

### Data Export (1)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `export_query_to_csv` | Execute a read-only SQL query and write the rows to a CSV file at a caller-specified path. Validator and audit log apply identically to `query`. The target directory must exist. |

### Statistics (2)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `summarize_table` | Per-table descriptive statistics: row count, per-column null rates, and sample value distributions for low-cardinality categorical columns. |
| `cohort_summary` | Aggregate demographics (age statistics, sex, race, ethnicity) for a cohort defined by a SQL subquery returning `PatientDurableKey`. Used as the closing summary at the end of a cohort-building workflow. |

## Guided Prompts

The server includes three MCP prompts that guide the LLM through common workflows:

- **clinical_data_exploration** — Step-by-step CDW exploration: schema overview, table discovery, query building
- **cohort_building** — Cohort identification workflow with correct patient identifier patterns and query optimization tips
- **notes_analysis** — Clinical notes investigation from patient identification through note retrieval and summarization

## Validation

CDWAgent has been end-to-end validated against the two BAA-covered LLM providers supported at UCSF:

- **Azure OpenAI GPT-5.2** via the UCSF unified-api endpoint
- **AWS Bedrock — Sonnet 4.6**

The eval suite covers cohort identification by structured codes, multi-criteria intersection, longitudinal lab and medication trajectories, NLP-based phenotype extraction over the cTAKES `note_concepts` and `note_concepts_sdoh` layers, OMOP↔CDW patient crossmapping, ambiguity disambiguation, and read-only enforcement. All cases pass against both providers under the v0.4.3 release. The eval harness lives in [`neuroGB/CDWAgent_testing`](https://github.com/neuroGB/CDWAgent_testing) (private).

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Access to a SQL Server Clinical Data Warehouse
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

### Quick install (uvx)

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/BaranziniLab/CDWAgent cdwagent
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaranziniLab/CDWAgent.git
cd CDWAgent
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database connection details
uv run cdwagent
```

### Run as a module

```bash
python -m cdwagent
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLINICAL_RECORDS_USERNAME` | Yes | SQL Server username |
| `CLINICAL_RECORDS_PASSWORD` | Yes | SQL Server password |
| `CLINICAL_RECORDS_SERVER` | No | SQL Server hostname (default: `QCDIDDWDB001.ucsfmedicalcenter.org`) |
| `CLINICAL_RECORDS_DATABASE` | No | Database name (default: `CDW_NEW`) |
| `CDW_NAMESPACE` | No | Tool name prefix (default: `CDW`) |
| `CDW_SCHEMA` | No | Database schema for table qualification (default: `deid_uf`) |
| `CDW_LOG_LEVEL` | No | Logging level (default: `INFO`) |

The server and database default to the UCSF CDW deployment. Set the env vars only to override (e.g. a different host or a development database).

## Use with BioRouter

CDWAgent is a standard stdio MCP server, so it registers as a BioRouter **Extension** exactly like UCSFOMOPAgent does — no BioRouter-specific code needed.

Add this block to `~/.config/biorouter/config.yaml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  cdwagent:
    type: stdio
    name: CDWAgent
    description: UF Epic Caboodle de-identified Clinical Data Warehouse (SQL Server, read-only)
    enabled: true
    cmd: uvx
    args: ["--from", "git+https://github.com/BaranziniLab/CDWAgent", "cdwagent"]
    timeout: 600
    envs:
      CLINICAL_RECORDS_USERNAME: "your-username"
      CLINICAL_RECORDS_PASSWORD: "your-password"
      CDW_SCHEMA: "deid_uf"
```

Server and database are hard-coded to the UCSF CDW deployment; override with `CLINICAL_RECORDS_SERVER` / `CLINICAL_RECORDS_DATABASE` only if needed.

Or via CLI:

```bash
biorouter session --with-extension "CLINICAL_RECORDS_USERNAME=... CLINICAL_RECORDS_PASSWORD=... uvx --from git+https://github.com/BaranziniLab/CDWAgent cdwagent"
```

**Tip — pairing with OMOPAgent:** enable both extensions to translate between the two clinical data representations. Ask BioRouter *"for OMOP person_id 12345, pull lab trends from the CDW side"* and it will call `CDW-crossmap_patient` then `CDW-get_labs`. See [`docs/BIOROUTER.md`](docs/BIOROUTER.md) for operational details (timeouts, malware check, tool-name disambiguation).

## Context Strategy (LLM dispatch optimization)

CDW Epic Caboodle uses a proprietary schema the LLM does not know from its training data (unlike OMOP CDM, where OHDSI terms are well-known). To minimize roundtrips and context usage, CDWAgent ships schema context at **two layers**:

1. **MCP `server instructions`** — a concise overview of the 14 most-used tables, patient identifier rules, date-column mapping per fact table, and the cohort subquery pattern. Sent once at session init via `InitializeResult.instructions` (FastMCP feature). BioRouter and other MCP clients fold this into the LLM's system prompt. Net effect: the LLM knows the schema the moment it picks any CDW tool, without a `get_database_overview` roundtrip.

2. **Tool descriptions** — kept short (~150 words each). Only the single most common failure mode (schema-qualification with `deid_uf.`) is repeated in the `query` tool description as a banner, since it is the top error source. Everything else lives in the server instructions.

Long tail: 139 total tables, ~5000 columns. Full listing is available on-demand via `get_database_overview` and `describe_table` — not pushed into the system prompt.

This is the generic pattern for MCPs targeting non-standard schemas. Thin tool descriptions + rich server instructions keeps turn-by-turn context small (tool descriptions are sent on every LLM turn; instructions are sent once) while still providing the context the LLM needs up front.

## Schema Reference

Schema discovery tools (`get_database_overview`, `describe_table`, `search_schema`) read from a pre-parsed JSON at [`src/cdwagent/data/schema_reference.json`](src/cdwagent/data/schema_reference.json) (bundled inside the Python package so `uvx` installs work out of the box) — **no database connection is required** for schema exploration. The JSON contains only structural metadata: table names, column names, data types, and descriptions. No patient data, no institutional identifiers.

**The source Epic Caboodle data dictionary (`.xlsx`) is intentionally NOT bundled with this repository.** It is a local governance artifact of each institution. The committed JSON is a derived representation — everything CDWAgent needs at runtime — but the original xlsx stays under institutional control.

If you need to regenerate `src/cdwagent/data/schema_reference.json` from an updated dictionary, obtain the xlsx through your institution's CDW governance channel and run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/parse_data_dictionary.py /path/to/deid_uf_data_dictionary.xlsx
```

## Security Policy

### Read-Only Enforcement

All SQL queries are validated before execution by `ClinicalQueryValidator`:

- Only `SELECT`, `WITH`, and `DECLARE` statements are allowed
- Write operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`, `EXEC`, `MERGE`, `CREATE`) are blocked
- Semicolons are rejected to prevent statement chaining
- Queries are validated after stripping SQL comments

### Credential Handling

- Database credentials are passed via environment variables, never hardcoded
- BioRouter stores credentials via `envs` (inline) or `env_keys` (OS keyring) in its config
- No credentials are logged or included in tool responses
